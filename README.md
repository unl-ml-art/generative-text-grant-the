# Project 1 Generative Text

Grant Stoner, gstoner2@unl.edu



## Abstract

My Project 1 proposal is to generate text based off of interior design blogs/webpages to see if the computer will design it's own room layout. I thought this could be a fun way to test the creativity of the code to see if soemthing worthwile will come of it. I would also like to look into possibly rendering some model of the room the generated text describes. My goals for this project are to see if the computer will pick up accurate design terminology and use it correctly to assemble some sort of unique room layout.

## Model/Data

Briefly describe the files that are included with your repository:
- trained models
- training data (or link to training data). what is your corpus?

## Code

Your code for generating your project:
- training_code.py or training_code.ipynb - your training code
- generative_code.py or generative_code.ipynb - your generation code

## Results

- Documentation of your generative text in an effective form. A file with your generated text (.pdf, .doc, .txt). 

## Technical Notes

Any implementation details or notes we need to repeat your work. 
- Does this code require other pip packages, software, etc?
- Does it run on some other (non-datahub) platform? (CoLab, etc.)

## Reference

References to any papers, techniques, repositories you used:
- Papers
  - [This is a paper](this_is_the_link.pdf)
- Repositories
- Blog posts
