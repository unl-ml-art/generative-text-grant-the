# Project 1 Generative Text

Grant Stoner, gstoner2@unl.edu


## Abstract
I decided to train GPT-2 on reports of UFO sightings. I used the output to record a type of radio show segment listing these generated sightings. I was very impressed with tthe unique nature of the sigtings it put out. The program also retained the format of the original file.

## Model/Data

Briefly describe the files that are included with your repository:
 - I combined the text files of four different lists of UFO sightings into one big text file which I used to train the model. I got the files from textfiles.com

## Results

- generated text: "UFO sightings output.docx"
